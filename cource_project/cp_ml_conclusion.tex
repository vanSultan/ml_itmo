\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

While doing this course work, I studied the phenomenon of fake news.
The analysis of the subject area was carried out, the most frequently used algorithms in this problem were identified.
Five algorithms were applied in practice to determine the type of news.
From the results, I can make an assumption that on the selected datasets, the Random Forests and Decision Tree methods show the best result.
Of these methods, the method of Random Forests proved to be the best in terms of quality metrics.
However, it should be clarified that this method is prone to retraining, as demonstrated by the example of the second data set.

As for the future work I would like to evaluate these methods on whether it is possible to replace the real data with synthetic in order to solve a Machine Learning Problem by learning a modified model on the sampled data and then evaluating the score which it obtains when evaluated on the real data.
